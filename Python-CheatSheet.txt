DATATYPES:

check DT - type()

Type Converstion:
Int to Str - str(num_variable)
Int to float - float(123)
f-String - print(f"String {num_variable}") - can use any DT without conversions.

String:
Subscript - method of pulling an element from a string.
ex: "Hello"[0]
Concat- 2 strings with plus
Built- in Functions - Len()

Integer:
Large Integers can be represented as 123_456_789 (computer ignores underscore and it is more readable for humans)
Flow division - (7//3) gives a int not float

Float:
3.14159
Divide(/) - gives a float
Built- in Functions - Round()

Boolean:
Camel Case True and False

Mathematical Operations: PEDMAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction) Left to Right

Functions:
Built-in functions, user defined functions

Function with inputs- Parameter and Arguments - Positional Argument(args should be in particular position), Keyword Argument (parameter = arg value, not specific to position)

Function with output - using return keyword 

Capitalize()- the capitalize() method converts first character of a string to uppercase letter and lowercases all other characters, if any
title() - The title() method returns a string where the first character in every word is upper case

DOC string: """ information of the function  """

SCOPE: 
Local Scope - Available within functions
Global Scope - Available anywhere in the file

Namespace: Anything we give name to has Namespace. Be considerate of scope of the variable or function name.

Block Scope: 
Any variable that is created inside a if/for/while loops and is indented and has a colon, then that is not permitted to local scope.
Whereas, variable created inside a if block inside a function, has local scope.

Modifying global scope: 
global keyword along with variable is used inside the functions to explicitly use the global scope variable.

Global Constants:
(PI = 3.14159) can be used as GC. These should be UPPER_CASE with underscope.

DATATYPES:

check DT - type()

Type Converstion:
Int to Str - str(num_variable)
Int to float - float(123)
f-String - print(f"String {num_variable}") - can use any DT without conversions.

String:
Subscript - method of pulling an element from a string.
ex: "Hello"[0]
Concat- 2 strings with plus
Built- in Functions - Len()

Integer:
Large Integers can be represented as 123_456_789 (computer ignores underscore and it is more readable for humans)
Flow division - (7//3) gives a int not float

Float:
3.14159
Divide(/) - gives a float
Built- in Functions - Round()

Boolean:
Camel Case True and False

Mathematical Operations: PEDMAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction) Left to Right

Functions:
Built-in functions, user defined functions
